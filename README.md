# Wordle
This is a simple, fun, and cheesy Wordle game built in Python! The goal is to guess a secret 5-letter word in 5 attempts. After each guess, the program will show you which letters are correct and in the right position (if any). If you guess the word correctly, youâ€™ll receive some cheesy, hilarious compliments to make you feel like a Wordle wizard.
